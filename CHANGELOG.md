### 0.0.11 "reorder" (2014-05-28)


#### Features

* **changelog:** add versionText, patchVersionText options ([9d8e0548](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog/commit/9d8e05480771f881c33e535f922401637f11861c))


#### Breaking Changes

* 
Removed versionLink and patchVersionLink options, and went back to the
default title output from 0.0.9.

If you wish to have a link to your version, simply customize the versionText
and patchVersionText options.
